# SimpleYugiohCardDatabaseWebsite
A Yugioh card displayer that shows stats and descriptions of a specified card.
The website allows you to search a specific card which then will make a call to my database to see if it is in. 
Then if the card is not in the database, it will use an jquery ajax call to a YugiohApi database which then it will retrieve
the info of the searched card and add to my database.

The Api I used is from this website https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/.
